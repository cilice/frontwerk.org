# What's next

We're not stopping here. In the hear future, Frontwerk will allow you to:

* Easily eject from using it (similar to [react-scripts][react-scripts]'s eject)
* Use [flow][flow] to check for type errors in your projects

Both these features are under development and you can follow along or even contribute [here][github].

> Hint: You can already use flow by running `frontwerk flow`, even though it's experimental at this stage.

[react-scripts]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts
[flow]: https://flow.org/
[github]: https://github.com/tricinel/frontwerk
